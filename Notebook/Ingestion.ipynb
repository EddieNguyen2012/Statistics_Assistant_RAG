This approach does no t assure correct conclusions. Bivariate screening for multivariate normality A bivariate scatterplot for any pair of variables in the model should yield and oval -shaped array of points if both variables are linearly related and normally distributed. While a step up, this is considered an exploratory approach. Residuals test. One approach is to regress each variable in the model on all other variables in the model, then save the residuals. If all the residual variables are normally distributed ex., by Q -Q plots, acceptable skew and kurtosis, etc., then it is assumed that the data are multivariate normal. OUTLIERS Outlying observations can radically alter the outcome of analysis and are also violations of normality. Outliers arise from four different causes, requiring different courses of action: Errors of data entry: proofread your data for out-of-range entries and other errors. Not defining missing values: check in SPSS or other statpacks to make sure 'don't know', 'not home', and other missing values are not being treated as real values. Unintended sampling: eliminate non- population members fr om the sample ex., eliminate unintentionally sampled out -of-town house guests from a sample for the population of city residents.\""
